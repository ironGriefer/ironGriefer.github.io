    <h1>WELCOME TO THE BEST WEBSITE EVER</h1>
    <p>Thank you for coming. This is the best website to ever exist. You will go on from life from now on enlighted, and you will see life through a new lense. This lense is made of salvation, and the souls of the darned. Please do not share this website with anyone. It is too important. If you share it with too many people, they might steal the salvation, and then I will be very angry. This salvation is made of ethans leg. Its very valuable.</p>
